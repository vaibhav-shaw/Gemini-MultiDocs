# 📚 Chat with PDF using Gemini

This project allows you to upload PDFs, process their text, and interactively ask questions about the content using Google Generative AI (`gemini-pro`). It uses Langchain for text processing, FAISS for vector storage, and Streamlit for the user interface.

## Features

- 📄 **Upload and Process PDF Files:** Extracts text from PDFs and splits it into manageable chunks for querying.
- 🤖 **Ask Questions:** Interact with the text using natural language queries powered by Google Generative AI (`gemini-pro`).
- 🧠 **Vector Store with FAISS:** Efficient similarity search over processed text chunks.
- 🔥 **Streamlit Web App:** User-friendly interface to upload PDFs and ask questions directly.
